// Runs the advisory Bash guards in one process. Each guard is a pure `check(command)`; first to
// block wins, otherwise any advisory context is surfaced. A guard that throws fails open (warned
// on stderr) so one bug can't swallow the rest. The deploy guard is separate — it fails closed.
//
// A guard exporting `scope = 'segment'` is called once per shell segment, so its ^-anchored
// regexes still match in `cd /repo && git worktree add ...`. It is opt-in rather than the default
// because some guards read the whole line by design: `suggest` allows `grep foo | wc -l` via a
// lookahead, and `cmux` allows `pnpm dev` only when the line mentions cmux — segmenting either
// would turn its deliberate allowance into a block.
